        I focus on functionalityâ€”ensuring the project works as intended. Once
        the core features are in place and the application is stable, I then
        shift my attention to refining the design and enhancing the user
        experience. <br /> <br /> I am a 4th-year student at Polytechnic
        University of the Philippines San Pedro Campus, passionate about web
        development. Your just so average programmer, I love and practice the
        MERN stack, with a strong focus on front-end development.
